Issue #1686
===========

The two example pages in this part both removes the secondary sidebar of the page, one
via the theme-specific configuration in ``conf.py`` and the other via page-wide
metadata. However, they are not behaving consistently.

Please check out the subpages for a better comparison. Please also refer to
`pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme#1686 <https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/1662>`_
for further discussions and details.
